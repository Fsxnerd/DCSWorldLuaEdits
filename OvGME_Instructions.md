## OvGME Instructions for setup and installation of Realistic Splash Damage Mod.

* Download OvGME from https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/OVGME#Download_the_installer
* Run installer following on-screen instructions(Installation location doesn't matter, however, for convenience I install to C:\OvGME)
* Upon install completion, access the properties of the OvGME executable by either right clicking the shortcut or the main executable and clicking properties. Click the compatibility tab and check the box that says run as administrator. Click Apply and Done.
