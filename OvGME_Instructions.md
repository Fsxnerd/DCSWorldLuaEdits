## OvGME Instructions for setup and installation of Realistic Splash Damage Mod.

* Download OvGME from https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/OVGME#Download_the_installer
* Run installer following on-screen instructions(Installation location doesn't matter, however, for convenience I install to C:\OvGME)
* Upon install completion, access the properties of the OvGME executable by either right clicking the shortcut or the main executable and clicking properties. Click the compatibility tab and check the box that says run as administrator. Click Apply and Done.
* Next, run OvGME. If it is your first time running it, you will be prompted to set up a configuration. You can name this configuration anything you want. Enter the folder location of your MAIN DCS INSTALL(NOT C:\users\*yourname*\savedgames). For example my main DCS install is at F:\DCS World. Also it will ask for your mods folder location. This CANNOT be the mods/Mods folder that is already in the folder structure of your DCS install. I recommend making a folder that can be easily remembered, such as "\_MODS". You will then enter this folder location in the OvGME config(ex: F:\DCS World\_MODS).
* After you have finished setting up your config, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to make a snapshot of your game files using OvGME so that when you do not want to use the mod, OvGME can set your files proper again and you wont have integrity check violations.
* The mods from Sabre will come in the proper folder format so all you will need to do is put the .zip file in your \_MODS folder. After putting the .zip file in your \_MODS folder, it should show up on OvGME. If not, just close and restart OvGME. When you see the mod appear in the "Disabled Mods" list, you can click on the mod and click "Enable". OvGME should then have a green check mark next to it and you should be good to go.

### If any of these instructions are unclear, you may reference the official OvGME website below, or contact Sabre in BuDs Discord.
